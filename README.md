# DR-1


This is the repo used to maintain the codebase for the DR-1 project at the [Florida Tech 
Dynamic Systems, Controls, and Mechatronics Lab.](https://research.fit.edu/dynamic-systems-and-controls-lab/)  The project utilizes the PX4 flight stack, MAVROS, and OpenCV in order to generate a relative state vector from a target position and generate the necessary commands for the flight computer in order to land on the target. System integration and testing occurs on a Gazebo flight simulator developed by the PX4 group using a Hardware-in-the-Loop approach, and on a Pixhawk equipped hexacopter. Algorithms and code validated on a Raspberry Pi 3B+, however will likely work on a wide variety of companion computers.
